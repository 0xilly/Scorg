# Scorg
A Language adapter for [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

## Why
I personally wanted an updated version of scala but I also don't believe Forge should providing the LanguageAdapter

## Usage
include `modLanguageAdapter = "io.github.illyohs.scorg.ScalaAdapter"` in your @Mod annotation

## Maven repo

```
TBD
